|    NOTE:                                          |
|    For complete functionality                     |
|    ADMIN role is required.                        |
|                                                   |
|    ADMIN role can only be added manually          |
|    to the database for security reasons.          |
|                                                   |
|    To do this you can execute couple queries      |
|    (using MySQLWorkbench for example)             |
|    from ADD ADMIN section of this README file.    |
|                                                   |
